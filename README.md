## Hello there!

I'm Brian, a Software Student currently taking Harvard's CS50 course.
I'm currently working on my [Final Project](https://github.com/SkyeEli/CS50-Final-Project) for CS50

## My Projects

* [Lottery Sim](https://github.com/SkyeEli/LotterySim), Simulate the number attempts to win the lottery!
* [Collatz Conjecture](https://github.com/SkyeEli/Collatz-Conjecture), This shows the Collatz Conjecture in action and calculates the steps to 1.

I have many other projects in-line with my studies that can be viewed here.
